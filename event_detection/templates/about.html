                <p>Jason J. Jung is a Full Professor at Chung-Ang University, Korea, since September 2014. Before
                    joining CAU, he was an Assistant
                    Professor in Yeungnam University, Korea, since 2007. Also, he was a postdoctoral researcher in INRIA
                    Rhone-Alpes,
                    France, in 2006, and a visiting scientist in Fraunhofer Institute (FIRST) in Berlin, Germany, in
                    2004. He received
                    the B.Eng. in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering from Inha University in 1999. He received
                    M.S. and Ph.D.
                    degrees in Computer and Information Engineering from Inha University in 2002 and 2005, respectively.
                    His research
                    topics are knowledge engineering on social networks by using many types of AI methodologies, e.g.,
                    data mining,
                    machine learning, and logical reasoning. Recently, he has been working on intelligent schemes to
                    understand various
                    social dynamics in large-scale social media (e.g., Twitter and Flickr).</p>
